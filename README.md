Titanic Survival Prediction:

Project summary: This notebook implements an end-to-end Titanic survival prediction pipeline: data import → exploratory data analysis (EDA) → data cleaning & imputation → feature engineering → encoding & scaling → model training (several classifiers) → hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation → evaluation and analysis of feature importance, with reproducible instructions and suggested next steps.

Dataset: the notebook uses the standard Kaggle Titanic dataset (train.csv and test.csv) which contains columns such as PassengerId, Survived (target: 0 = no, 1 = yes), Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and Embarked. The notebook documents initial shape, missing-value counts, and basic summary statistics for each column.

What I did:

Data loading & quick checks: loaded train.csv and test.csv, printed head/tail, .info(), .describe(), and missing-value counts to get a baseline understanding of the data quality and column types.

Data cleaning & missing-value handling: examined missingness patterns; used a combination of imputers and strategies (as implemented in the notebook) such as SimpleImputer (mode/median) and more advanced imputation experiments (KNNImputer, IterativeImputer) where appropriate; filled Embarked with the mode when missing; treated Cabin missing values by filling with a placeholder like 'Unknown' and then extracting deck information (first letter) where possible; handled Fare and Age missing values with robust imputations (experiments with median, KNN, and iterative regression imputers are included) and documented the final choice and reasoning in the notebook.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): produced visual and numeric EDA to reveal relationships with survival, including:

survival rate by Sex (male vs female),

survival rate by Pclass (1/2/3),

age distribution and survival across age groups (children vs adults),

fare distribution and survival,

sibling/spouse and parent/child counts and survival,

correlation heatmap and pairwise comparisons where useful,

barplots and histograms (Seaborn/Matplotlib) and interactive figures (Plotly) to help visualize key relationships.
Key EDA findings are summarized in the notebook (e.g., females have higher survival rates, higher classes have higher survival, children often have higher survival odds, family size impacts survival—small families more likely to survive than large families or isolated passengers).

Feature engineering: created several new, predictive features, including:

FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1,

IsAlone (derived from FamilySize),

Title extracted from Name (e.g., Mr/Mrs/Miss/Dr/etc.) and grouped rare titles into an "Other" category,

Deck extracted from Cabin first letter (with missing cabins as 'Unknown'),

binned Age into categories (child/teen/adult/senior) and optionally binned Fare into quantiles,

interaction features where useful (e.g., Pclass × Title),

any ordinal encoding decisions are documented (e.g., Pclass kept as ordinal numeric).

Encoding & scaling: applied categorical encodings (one-hot / get_dummies for nominal features; label/ordinal encoding for ordinal features where appropriate) and numerical scaling where models required it (the notebook documents whether StandardScaler or RobustScaler was used and why).

Model building & selection: trained and compared multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost (the notebook shows implementation details for RandomForestClassifier and XGBClassifier), evaluated performance with cross-validation and held-out validation, and used grid/randomized search for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV) with cross_val_score to reduce overfitting risk.

Evaluation metrics & validation: evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices; reported cross-validated metrics and final validation/test set metrics; included classification_report to show per-class precision/recall/F1; plotted ROC curves where useful; discussed trade-offs between metrics (e.g., precision vs recall) and why one model was chosen as final.

Feature importance & interpretation: extracted feature importances from tree-based models (Random Forest/XGBoost) and/or inspected coefficients from linear models, presented the top predictive features (e.g., Sex, Pclass, Title, Age, FamilySize), and discussed model interpretability and pitfalls.

Reproducibility and code hygiene: used a fixed random_state for reproducibility, documented the sequence of data transformations in the notebook so the pipeline can be re-run end-to-end, and suggested creating a requirements.txt (sample provided below) to ensure consistent environments.

Key findings (summary of EDA & model insights): females had substantially higher survival probability; Pclass is strongly predictive (1st class > 2nd > 3rd); children and certain titles (e.g., Master, Miss) show different survival patterns; family-related features (FamilySize, IsAlone) influence survival; fare and deck (when derivable) add predictive signal; ensemble tree methods (Random Forest/XGBoost) typically outperformed baseline logistic regression in the experiments recorded in the notebook.
